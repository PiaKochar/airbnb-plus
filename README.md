# airbnb-plus

This project is a Google Chrome extension intended to be used on Airbnb site listings as users are choosing a place to stay. It provides listings of attractions, food, bike share stations, public transit stations, and recently reported crimes near the listing a user is currently looking at. The chrome extension allows quick and clear access to data that helps give users a clearer picture of the merits of different listings. This information is aggregated from the following APIs: EveryBlock API, Indego Bike, Google Places and Google Maps Geocoding.

This app was created during PennApps Spring 2016 by Lucy Chai and Pia Kochar.
